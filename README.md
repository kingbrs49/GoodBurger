# GoodBurger
Welcome to Good Burger, Home of the Good Burger, Can I take your order? **huh**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

"GoodBurger", based on the Nickelodeon movie of the same name (but not really), is a Full-Stack App utilizing a combination of technologies. The app lets you make, order, and eat burgers of your choosing. Simply choose a Good Burger on the left side of the screen to eat, by clicking the red "EAT ME!! HAH!!" button. Good Burger's patented MySQL program will read the burger as eaten, and move it to the right side of the screen.

## Getting Started

In order to run the application locally, you must first clone this repository to your machine with the following:

```
git clone git@github.com:kingbrs49/GoodBurger.git
```
