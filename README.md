# GoodBurger
Welcome to Good Burger, Home of the Good Burger, Can I take your order? **huh**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

"GoodBurger", based on the Nickelodeon movie of the same name (but not really), is a Full-Stack App that lets you make, order, and eat burgers of your choosing, using "cutting-edge" MySQL technology.

Simply choose a Good Burger on the left side of the screen to eat, by clicking the red "EAT ME!! HAH!!" button. Good Burger's patented MySQL program will read the burger as eaten, and move it to the right side of the screen.
