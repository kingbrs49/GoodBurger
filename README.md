# Overview

"GoodBurger", based on the Nickelodeon movie of the same name (but not really), is a Full-Stack App using Node, Express, MySQL, and Handlebars. The app lets you make, order, and eat burgers of your choosing. Simply choose a Good Burger on the left side of the screen to eat, by clicking the red "EAT ME!! HAH!!" button. Good Burger's patented MySQL program will read the burger as eaten, and move it to the right side of the screen.
