# GoodBurger
Welcome to Good Burger, Home of the Good Burger, Can I take your order? **huh**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"GoodBurger", based on the Nickelodeon movie of the same name (but not really), is a Full-Stack App that lets you make, order, and eat burgers of your choosing. 

Simply ... uh ...

Well, you, uh ... I mean ...

... Okay, guys, I'm going to be honest with you.

I have no idea if this app works. 

As a matter of fact, I'm simply turning this in because I need the credit. But the bottom line is this assignment kicked my ass. Hopefully, I will not let this damn thing beat me completely -- I will return to this assignment sometime in the near future, and I will figure this out. Until then, I need to get to reviewing all the stuff that confused the hell out of me -- Handlebars, SQL, how everything weaves together, the whole 9. 

Anyway, I just wanted to be straight with you, T.A. who is reading this right now (Hi Hoff and/or Justin!) -- I'll most definitely work on this app again, and turn in a better effort.
